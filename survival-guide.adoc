This document will guide you through the ways of website edition.

== TL;DR

Wanna start hacking right away? This section is for you.

Look at the `search` directory for inspiration in content, structure and markup examples.

To start a new project, for example ORM, do the following:

. create the project directory `mkdir orm`
. copy the pages from search `cp -R search/ orm`
. create a project section in `_config/site.yml` under `projects`.
.. best is to simply copy the search subsection and update the data
.. the project section name is lowercase and corresponds to the URL path (`search` and not `hibernate-search`)
. edit the pages (*.haml, *.adoc) under `orm/` and replace the `project` or `awestruct-project` attribute to the lowercase project name

== Prerequisites

Follow the link:/README/[README] instructions to get Awestruct and its dependencies up and running.

== How to edit

Use your favorite editor. I personally use +vim+.
All pages are using text based markups with various degrees of flexibility and readability.
Indentation is two spaces.

CAUTION: In Ruby indentation matters, be careful.

=== Live reload (optional)

You can make the editing/reviewing work-flow faster by using the
livereload plugin in your browser.

. Install the appropriate http://livereload.com/extensions/[live reload plugin].
. Start `guard` (in separate terminal from the root of the repository checkout)
+
[source]
----
bundle exec guard
----

Every time you save a file, the web page will be automatically reloaded assuming you have activated the browser plugin.

== Add a page

There are two types of pages, http://haml.info[HAML] based (`*.html.haml`) and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc] (`*.adoc`).

HAML::
HAML is close to HTML and let's you use Ruby. Use this when you need special layouts in your page or use the site metadata.
In general, only super users should use them.
Asciidoc::
Asciidoc is a markup language close to Markdown but more powerful. When you start a page, prefer this format.
The best resource to learn the Asciidoc syntax are http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[the writer guide] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the syntax quick reference].

[TIP]
.Best of both worlds?
====
You can embed Asciidoc fragments inside a haml page.

[source]
----
.row-fluid
  .span6
    :asciidoc
      == Some header

      And now I'm back in plain Asciidoc with http://example.com[links] and all.
  -# Back in HAML, notice the indetation
  .span6
----
====

A file named `downloads.html.haml` or `downloads.adoc` in the `search` directory will generate `/search/downloads/index.html` that we reference as `/search/downloads/` at it makes for nicer URLs. If you plan to create several pages under the `download/` path, create the `download` directory and add `search/downloads/index.html.haml` or `search/downloads/index.adoc`.

=== Page attributes

Each page has some metadata attributes associated and put at the top of the file.

[source,haml]

....
----
# note that the first block in haml should be surrounded by `---` and not `----`
# but a rending bug prevents the listing to properly show it
layout: project-frame
title: About Hibernate Search
project: search
title_partial: project/title-about.html.haml
----

    .row-fluid
      .span12.feature-block
        :asciidoc
          === Full-text search for entities

          Offers full-text search support for objects stored by Hibernate ORM, Infinispan and other sources.
          Think of it as Google(tm) for your entities:

          * search words with text
          * order results by relevance
          * find by approximation (fuzzy search)

You've got a question burning you? We might have the answer for you.

== Indexes

=== No file created in index directory

Hibernate Search won't create a new index in existing directories.
....

Here is a list of the most useful attributes.

layout (or awestruct-layout in Asciidoc)::
Represents the layout the page will use. Layouts are present in the `_layout` directory
title::
The page title.
+
[NOTE]
====
The page title of an Asciidoc file is the text in the first line following `=`.

----
= Some title
:some-attribute: value

Preamble (usually bigger)

== First section

Some text.
----
====
project (or awestruct-project)::
Optional. Represents the project the page descrcibes. Used to properly compute navigation.
Mandatory if the page is under the project subdirectory.
toc (Asciidoc only)::
Optional. Enable the rendering of the table of content in Asciidoc documents
toc-placement (Asciidoc only)::
Mandatory if `toc` is used. On this website, the table of content position is imposed and defined in css.
Just set the value to _preamble_.
toc-title (Asciidoc only)::
Optional. Defines the table of content title. Defaults to _Table of content_.
numbered (Asciidoc only)::
Number the sections and the ToC.

== List of layouts

Layouts are used to share the same site structure. They can be nested.
All are in the `_layouts` directory.
There are a few important layouts:

* `project` (`project.html.haml`): it represents a generic page structure (we will change the name in a little while)
* `project-frame` (`project/project-frame.html.haml`): represents a project specific page. All files under `search`, `orm`, `validator` etc. use this layout
* `title-nocol` (`common/title-nocol.html.haml`): represents a generic page with a title and no column. Useful for generic Asciidoc pages like this one.

=== Partials

Partials (in the `_partials` directory) are page fragments that can be reused from within a haml page or layout.

CAUTION: Partials do not get automatically refreshed when change. You need to stop, clean and restart Awestruct `rake clean preview`.

[[staging]]
== Preview changes on staging.hibernate.org

Use git to push your changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/staging[staging branch]
on link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org[GitHub].

The staging site can be used for various experiments with the site L&F and content.
For this reason, ou might need to use `git push --force` to overwrite previous experiments.

// staging.hibernate.org is not rendered as URL to limit the crawling
// TODO create a noindex in robots.txt for non production profiles

Pushing changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/staging[staging branch]
will trigger the link:http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/staging.hibernate.org/[staging.hibernate.org]
job on the Hibernate link:http://ci.hibernate.org[CI Server]. The content of
staging.hibernate.org will be automatically updated as part of a successful
build.

[[publishing]]
== Publish changes to hibernate.org

Use git to push your changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch] of the
repository on link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org[GitHub].

[NOTE]
====
When adding a new release to the site, one needs to make sure that the release artifacts
are already published. Part of the site generation is to parse the release metadata from
the release POM. If the artifact is not yet published an error will occur!
====

Your changes need to be a fast forward of the link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch]. Never use the `--force` option in this case!
If you have a push error, rebase first and possibly repeat the <<staging,staging>> phase.

Pushing changes to the
link:https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate.org/tree/production[production branch]
will trigger the link:http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Website/job/www.hibernate.org/[www.hibernate.org]
job on the Hibernate link:http://ci.hibernate.org[CI Server]. The content of
link:http://hibernate.org[hibernate.org] will be automatically updated as a result
of a successful build.
