Hibernate Search is a fully supported component of Red Hat JBoss EAP as part of the https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes] offering.
Using JBoss EAP, Quarkus, Open Liberty or Spring Boot? They are all part of Red Hat Runtimes.

[Red Hat Data Grid](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid) also uses a custom edition of Hibernate Search internally to provide high performance full-text queries and data mining on the data grid.

Several more products from Red Hat are powered by Hibernate Search.
